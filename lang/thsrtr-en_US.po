"The Sorter handles two concepts: Areas and Items. Areas groups items and "

msgstr ""

#: ../howto.php:44
msgid ""
"Areas consists of zones where the items are dropped to be displayed later. "
"And items are references to the posts, fancy links with lot of properties "

msgid ""
"In order to take advantage of The Sorter in its entirety, after the set up, "
"you must follow these steps:"
msgstr ""

#: ../howto.php:51
msgid ""
"<strong>Create an Area.</strong> Go to 'Areas' and create an area using the "
"form. The only field you MUST complete is the Name. The templates already "
"have a default value. But of course, you can edit them to stylize the output "
"the way you like. Anyway, is important to tell you that you MUST HAVE some "
"HTML knowledge to edit the templates. In case you mess with that code "
"without knowing what you are doing, the output might not work properly."
msgstr ""

#: ../howto.php:53
msgid ""
"<strong>Add an Item.</strong> After having created the area, you have to "
"populate it with 'Items', which are actually fancy links, with HTML elements "
"that you can add or remove. They point to the entries you have made, of any "
"kind: posts, pages, media files and custom post types. In order to add the "
"items, you must go to the main page of the plugin (The Sorter) and click on "
"the button displaying 'Add Item', which will open a little window with a "
"form within. First, pick which kind of post you want to get. After this, a "
"second field appear. There you have to pick the post you want to link a "
"reference with. After having picked the post and pressed the Save button, "
"then you have to see the element created just below the name of the area in "
"which you added the item."
msgstr ""

#: ../howto.php:55
msgid ""
"<strong>Order 'a piacere'.</strong> Once you have multiple items within an "
"area, you can use drag and drop to place the items in the order you wish. "
"You will see the current order number at the top right corner of the item, "
"showing you the final order the elements will take when displayed."
msgstr ""

#: ../howto.php:57
msgid ""
"<strong>Add the code or the widget.</strong> This is the last step. Once you "
"add the code, you are free to go. Go to the Areas' Page. There you will see "
"the list of the created areas. Once you find the one you were looking for, "
"place the cursor over the name. There you'll see a menu appearing below that "
"name. Clic the 'View Code' option. Now you have two options: Add the PHP "
"code within a page of the theme you like, or add the area's 'shortcode' to "
"any specific entry, like a page, a post or custom one. <strong>BE CAREFUL:</"
"strong> The first one only works within PHP files. The second one is meant "
"to be used only within Wordpress' entries, that is why they have so "
"different syntaxes. WIDGET: You can also add an instance of the widget in "
"any dynamic sidebar your theme could have."
